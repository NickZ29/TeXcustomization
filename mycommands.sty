% the \rainbow command takes in text and ouputs the text in a rainbow coloring path. Output 
% will remove any whitespace contained in argument. A space can be added in the output 
% using the \rainbowspace character. Unexpected results may occur when any non-standard 
% character is passed as argument.

    \newcommand{\bazinga}{"I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer" Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back 
    seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline. "Why not? Don't you like the internet?" The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that 
    they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is 
    clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen. "I just 
    prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble." The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. 
    They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, 
    the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. 
    is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and 
    Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around 
    him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before 
    this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes 
    his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an 
    eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, 
    he says with resounding conviction... "BAZINGA" In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child 
    all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. 
    Peace at last.}
